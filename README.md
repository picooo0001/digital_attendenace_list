# Digital attendance list
This project is about a digital attendance list. The lecturer / teacher / etc. can generate a QR code that pupils / students / participants can scan to confirm their attendance. The tool compares the geolocation in the background and writes participants who are actually present in a database. 

3 views are required:
The lecturer view. This is for the lecturer only. He can create QR codes for classes and see the insights.
The student view. This is for the student only. The student can set up his account there by filling in the required details.
The "attendance" vew. This it the view after the QR code got scanned. In this view it should be possible to check in.
